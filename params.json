The experiments are written in Python (2.7), and use [IPython notebooks](https://ipython.org/), and  requires the installation of the `eoldas_ng` package, as well as the `gp_emulators` packages, as well as the standar Python scientific stack ([numpy](http://numpy.org), [scipy](http://scipy.org) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)). You can probably install most of this using the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).\r\n\r\nFor more information, contact the author at ``j.gomez-dans AT ucl.ac.uk``\r\n",
